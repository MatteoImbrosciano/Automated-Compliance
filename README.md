# Balanced-Management

I am a university student who faces a variety of different commitments on a daily basis. In addition to regularly attending classes and dedicating time to studying, I also take on part-time jobs to support myself financially and participate in extracurricular activities such as sports. Although these activities are important, I often find it difficult to manage my time effectively. One of the main problems I face is the lack of balance between the hours dedicated to studying and those reserved for recreational activities or rest. Sometimes I end up sacrificing sleep or leisure time to complete assignments or prepare for exams, which, over time, causes physical and mental fatigue, reducing my overall productivity. I would like to have a tool that allows me to better plan my time, helping me to set priorities and organize my week in such a way that study hours, work, and extracurricular activities are distributed evenly, avoiding reaching the end of the day completely exhausted.
