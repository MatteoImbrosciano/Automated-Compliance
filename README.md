# Medication-Management

I am a person who needs to regularly purchase medications from a pharmacy for personal or family needs. When I make a purchase, I receive an electronic receipt with details of the medications bought, including the name of the medication, the quantity, and the purchase date. However, to keep track of the stock of medications I already have at home and to avoid buying new ones unnecessarily, I have to manually transfer this information into a separate list.
This process is slow and prone to errors. 
I would like an automated way to read electronic receipts and automatically update my medication inventory, so that I always have a clear view of what medications I have on hand and when I need to purchase more
