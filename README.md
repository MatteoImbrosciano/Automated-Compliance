### Urban-Traffic


I am a student who depends on public transport to get around the city, I often find myself dealing with urban traffic and traffic jams, especially during rush hours. This issue, unfortunately, makes my commute take longer than expected and often leads to significant delays. I would like to optimize my time and be able to count on more efficient means of transport, but currently I find myself having to wait even when traffic is particularly congested.

## Objetivos del problema

- **Explore and use alternative transportation options based on the traffic situation.**
- **Minimize waiting times at public transport stops.**
- **Monitor traffic levels in critical areas of the city, especially during rush hours.**
- **Have access to information on public transport timetables and any delays.**
